## Description
A CLI application that generates a roster of employee cards. Currently, it builds a roster of one manager and indefinite number of engineers and interns using user prompts. The backend has a focus on object oriented programming to create an assortment of subclasses extending from the main employee class. Cards can easily be modified to adjust roles and fields for each employee. It was built on node using inquirer and the filesystem modules.
